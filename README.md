## Building
  For the basic setup of OSC with MoCap and gearVR look at the instructions from [this library](https://github.com/hku-ect/UnityOSCToolkit)
  After that you make a new project and paste the files in the root folder of your project.

  To be able to play you should launch you need to build with the handshake scene (located at: Assets/UnityOSC-Toolkit/Examples/handshake-     scene.unity) as the first scene.
